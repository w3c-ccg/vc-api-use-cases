      <p>
        Fundamentally, the Verifiable Credential API (VC-API) is a standard developed to give technologists a way to enable holders of
        VCs to use them how and where they choose. Verifiable Credentials make claims which may be a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece 
        of information about an entity's background such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. 
        The use cases outlined here are provided to help make progress toward possible future standardization and interoperability of the transport
        of both low- and high-stakes claims as outlined in the VC Use Cases. The use cases in this document focus on concrete 
        scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
      </p>

        This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases meant
        to be reviewed alongside the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/">Verifiable
        Credentials API</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work on this document is ongoing and subject to change as the conversation around the
        VC API evolves in the main group. This should currently be treated as a draft document and
        as such will have errors. As the VC API gets closer to a completed specification, this 
        document should reflect the current understanding and status of that work.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The VC-API Working Group at the W3C is developing standards for
        exchanging Verifiable Credentials that have been verified by a third
        party and to make them easier for holders to use on the Web and in life.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>Importance of this work</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Entities</a> (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of
          <a>claims</a> as part of their everyday activities. As more and more of these
          important activities move to the Internet, <a>entities</a> need to be able to
          transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their location,
          accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records to payment
          account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize
          <a>entities</a> to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by
          trusted parties. The Holders of these claims, in the form of Verfiable Credentials,
          need to be able to take the claims they control and make use of them where, when,
          and how they wish, often in ways the original issuer of the VC may not have 
          originally indended. Having a common, standard way for these Holders of claims
          to use them as they wish is vital to a person having control of their own data. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Standardization of the transport layer for digital <a>claims</a> makes it possible for many
          stakeholders to interact with their desired counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Use case model</h3>
      <p>
          This document presents an aggregate use case model, comprised of Needs, Roles,
          Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the use cases that
          the VC-API Working Group has addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
          User needs define the problem space addressed by <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>.
          User Roles specify the roles different <a>entities</a> play when interacting
          with <a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. Tasks define the functions users can
          accomplish, and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized, by
          interactions between <a>entities</a> over time.
      </p>
      <p>
          As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The
          listed uses cannot capture all possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not
          completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model
          is intended to provide specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model used here draws heavily from the Verifiable Credentials Use Cases model.
        This is due to the fact that the VC-API is meant to support the transport of 
        VCs in the use cases considered for the Verfiable Credential Working Group.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h2>User Roles</h2>
      <p>
        There are three roles supported by <a>Verifiable Credentials</a> as defined by the 
        VCWG: <a>Issuer</a>, <a>Verifier</a>, and <a>Holder</a>. In the VC Use Cases, a fourth
        role — that of subject — is defined. However, for the purposes of the VC-API, the subject
        is not relevant except when the same entity is both the Holder and the subject. For this
        reason, the Subject role does not appear in the VC-API.
      </p>  
      <figure>
        <img alt="VC-API User Roles" 
           style="display:block; margin:auto"
           src="user-roles.png" />
        <figcaption>
          VC-API User Roles
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The above roles were those defined for the VCWG, however, due to the way most 
        production software on the internet works, for the purposes of the VC-API there arises
        the need to delve into some detail as to how the Issuer and Verifier roles are structured.
        This is due to the fact that there are many use cases where one company is making use of 
        services to handle part of the technology stack. This has led to both Verifier
        and Issuer splitting into two entities each, henceforth refered to as components of the 
        Issuer and Verifier: <a>Issuer Service</a>, <a>Issuer Coordinator</a>,
        <a>Verifier Service</a>, and <a>Verifier Coordinator</a>. 
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          VC-API Role Components
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The respective Service and Coordinator components combine to fulfill
        the role of the Issuer and Verifier as described in the VCWG. 
        It is fully expected by the VC-API that software will exist that may fulfill only part of
        any of the roles, by implementing any combination of these component roles: 
        <a>Issuer Service</a>, <a>Issuer Coordinator</a>
        <a>Verifier Service</a>, and <a>Verifier Coordinator</a>.

          A couple of years after Joleen succussfully started an "extended transcript"
          program at the Unniversity she works for, the administration has decided to
          issue all transcripts digitally. As such they upgrade the system to make use
          of Education Credential Issuer Inc's issuing service, and put together a new
          web page to act as their issueing coordinator. Once the system is in place,
          Joleen pushes an email notification to the student body, both past and present,
          that they can now receive digital transcripts at the newly created website to 
          the digital wallet of their choice.

          Eunice is about to take her ACT (a test used to evaluate her readiness for
          college). When she arrives at the testing center, she is required to present
          identification. She presents her government-issued identity credential in the
          form of a QR Code to the test runner, who scans it. The test runner's device
          acts as the verification coordinator, which makes use of the ACT orginization's
          verification service to verify the presented identification credential. 
          Everything checks out with Eunice's identification and she sits down to 
          take the text.

          to use it. In his third year, Rocky decides to transfer to Moosylvania Tech.
          They do not offer a service, but he does not want to continue to use the
          service of his old (and now rival school) so he moves his <a>verifiable credentials</a> to the
          service offered by his bank without needing to have them reissued.

          provide his credentials to prove his identity before the test, which he does
          in the form of a government-issued idenfication credential. MOOC uses a backend
          verification service which verifies these, and once they are satisfied that Nick
          is who he says he is, have Nick take the courses he signed up for. At the end of
          the courses, MOOC then uses their proprietary issuer service to provide Nick a

          discount for customers who make verifiable addresses available as part of the
          checkout process. Francis offers a verifiable credential--containing a claim by a known authority that a specific address has been verified--to Giant Shoe Company's

          to sell such gifts, while in fact they only take the cash, and disappear on
          Mondays. So before actually purchasing a gift from the web shop of his choice,
          he requests the shop to provide a credential issued by the chamber of commerce,
          that contains proof of legitimacy. After having verified that the shop is

          Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland.  As part of that process,
          the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of possible sources to confirm
          her identity &mdash; a so-called &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; check. She goes
          to the bank website, logs in, and navigates to the KYC page. She then
          selects the government-supplied <a>verifiable credentials</a> that confirm she
          receives postal mail at a certain address and that she has a national ID card.
          She submits these to Midbank's verification coordinator. MidBank has their own verification service, which 
          checks the provided credentials, and confirms that they are properly issues,
          and still valid, credentials issued to Jane. Confirming these allows the bank 
          to open her account and be confident in her identity when she conducts transactions.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Now that the account is open, Jane is issued, by MidBank's Issuer Service,
          a digitally-signed <a>credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank. 
          This <a>credential</a> verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank 
          and has access to her associated checking account. Since MidBank 
          (and all banks in Finland) are required to perform &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; 
          checks on accounts, this credential can also be used as sufficient 
          verification by other financial institutions. This can help Jane assure 
          destination banks that she is verified, thereby allaying concerns about 
          misdirected transactions and money laundering.

              so he puts the end-point provided by HVAC Manufacturing for these types of 
              purposes into his fan-controller's settings page. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Sam is concerned about the security of the smart board room. He configures
              the autonomously interacting devices to re-verify device trustworthiness
              attributes periodically by re-checking that the device originated from HVAC
              Manufacturing and was handled correctly by Certifications Testing Lab and
              installed with the correct software package by VAR Resellers. For this purpose,
              Sam does not trust HVAC Manufacturing's verifier service, as there could be
              a conflict of interest there, so Sam instead decides to use Generic HVAC
              Verifier's verification service, adding the provided end-point to the approriate
              configuration files so the devices use his selected verification services. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Sam may update the device’s software occasionally during its lifetime. Even
              though Sam is applying the update, VAR Resellers supplies the correct update.
              The device ensures that only VAR Resellers is able to supply the updated
              software image and that only Sam is able to apply the update.

    <h3>Get Digital Permanent Resident Card</h3>
    <p>Lana is an IT administrator for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 
      Digital Permanent Resident Card (PRC) program. She configures the USCIS website to issue digital 
      Permanent Resident Cards by utilizing industry standard issuer software and setting up the appropriate 
      HTTP API Authorizations between systems. Legal Permanent Residents, upon receiving their physical card 
      in the mail, are given the USCIS website URL, a login account, and PIN code that they may use to manage 
      their account and pick up their digital Permanent Resident Card. When Louis, a Legal Permanent Resident, 
      requests a digital Permanent Resident Card via the USCIS website, he authenticates using his login account 
      and once authenticated, provides a DID associated with his client-side digital wallet against which the 
      website will issue VCs. The USCIS website then connects to the digital card issuing server, which builds 
      the Verifiable Credential Permanent Resident Card using Louis' account data, and then utilizes industry 
      standard HTTP APIs to issue the Permanent Resident Card as a Verifiable Credential. Louis can then use his 
      Digital Permanent Resident Card in online scenarios when he needs to prove his resident status, such as 
      when applying for a job.</p>

    <h3>Refresh Expired Over Age Token</h3>
    <p>Riley has onboarded into the TruAge digital age verification system, which has provided her 
      with a set of Verifiable Credentials that she stores in her digital wallet. A subset of the 
      Verifiable Credentials that she has received are digitally signed single-use age tokens that 
      only assert that she is above the age of 21 and are marked as "used" by the TruAge system 
      when they are submitted as a part of an age-restricted goods purchase, such as buying a 
      bottle of wine. Eventually, Riley runs out of single use age tokens in her digital wallet. 
      The digital wallet keeps track of which tokens have been used and once all tokens have been 
      consumed, contacts a refresh service endpoint listed in one of the TruAge credentials that 
      provides new over-age tokens. The digital wallet requests a new set of tokens by hitting the 
      HTTP API of this VC-refresh service listed in the “refreshService” array and POSTing the 
      original Verifiable Credential containing the refresh service description. The HTTP API 
      ensures that it has received a valid credential and reissues a set of new digitally signed 
      single-use age tokens in the response.

    <h3>Execute Multi-stage Presentation Workflow</h3>
    <p>Description: Ignio, a logistics manager for "Kirk Company", would like to submit all necessary paperwork 
      to send his company's products across international boundaries. These products are considered hazardous 
      chemicals and thus are regulated, requiring extra paperwork to be filed before transportation is approved 
      across boundaries. Some hazardous material shipments are different resulting in different required paperwork, 
      and Ignio wants to automate as much of the process as possible with Shippers, 
      their 3rd Party Logistics company (3PL). There are a set of verifiable credentials that Ignio is willing to 
      share with Customs as well as the transportation company. 
    </p>
    <p>When Kirk starts a shipping workflow, his company's systems initiate the workflow by contacting a known 
      location on the Shipper's Website. A presentation exchange occurs to first DIDAuth the company and send 
      generic mandatory information for any shipment; if and only if the information provided requires additional 
      information‒in this case a hazmat certification‒a second exchange is initiated to request this outstanding/required 
      hazmat info.  Once this is received, Shippers can send back a Bill of Lading in VC form. The two (or more) 
      credential exchanges are composable and idempotent, ending in a valid BoL if successful.

    <h3>Aggregated Credential Workflow</h3>
    <p>Kenzie is using digital credentials to apply for a job at as a teacher. 
      Her teaching certification is already in her digital wallet but the school also requires a 
      criminal background check for which Kenzie does not currently have a credential. The process
      of getting the background check can take 24&ndash;48 hours. Kenzie goes to the job application
      website and submits her application; the website responds requesting both her teaching credential
      and a criminal background check credential --issued by some set of known issuers?--

      Some of his credentials are available today, some will need to be provided when they are ready 
      (for example, a criminal background check can take 24-48 hrs to process). He would like these credentials to 
      be presented to the Verifier (service provider) when ready, without having to constantly return to the Verifier 
      (service provider) and deliver them "by hand". He should be able to have them released from his Holder directly 
      as they become available.</p>

    <h3>Submit/Sign/Verify a test credential to a licensure system</h3>
    <p>A student, Shabazz, wants to publish their MBLEx test results from an education test provider, 
      Massage Therapy Test Corp. Massage Therapy Test Corp proxies their authority to sign to a service provider, 
      SSI Ventures.  SSI Ventures issues Shabazz a VC when he logs into his Massage Therapy Test Corp account 
      and enables his browser-based SSI Wallet, Billfold.  The signed VC is then stored in Shabazz’ Billfold™ Wallet 
      to be presented elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>In a separate session, Shabazz logs into a web portal of a State Massage Therapy licensure system to 
      apply for his Massage Therapy license. The licensure specialist at the State checks the issuer using a 
      State accreditation system, then checks the signature on the test results VC and ingests the 
      credential’s payload. The licensure specialist then finalizes their workflow and issues 
      Shabazz a Massage Therapy license.

    <h3>Supply Chain Import</h3>
    <p>In order to export steel products to the global market, Steel Mills Global must prove 
      the quality of their products. For this, they rely on Inspectors & Co, an internationally 
      recognized steel testing company. Upon inspection, Inspectors & Co issues a 
      Mill Test Report VC to Steel Mills Global.</p>
    <p>Steel Inc. imports and distributes steel products domestically. Negotiating a shipment 
      Steel Mills Global presents the MTR as proof of product quality. Steel Inc. verifies the
      MTR VP and accepts the shipment. </p>
    <p>Steel Inc. initiates the importing procedures, starting out self-issuing an 
      Import Declaration Form VC. The MTR and IDF are jointly presented to the Customs 
      authority which verifies the VP. Upon verification the customs release is granted for goods import. </p>
      </p>
    <p><i>Note: These VC types are taken from the <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="">Traceability Vocabulary</a>, a W3C-CCG work item for supply chain use-cases.</i></p>
      <p><b>Requirements:</b><ul>
        <li>1. VC Issuance,</li>
        <li><i>X. Self-Issuance,</i></li>
        <li>X. Re-Presentation and VC+VP Verification across a common supply chain process.</li>
